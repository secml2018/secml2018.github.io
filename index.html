    <i>Abstract</i>—There is growing recognition that ML exposes new vulnerabilities in software systems. Some of the threat vectors explored so far include training data poisoning, adversarial examples or model extraction. Yet, the technical community's understanding of the nature and extent of the resulting vulnerabilities remains limited. This is due in part to (1) the large attack surface exposed by ML algorithms because they were designed for deployment in benign environments---as exemplified by the IID assumption for training and test data, (2) the limited availability of theoretical tools to analyze generalization, (3) the lack of reliable confidence estimates. In addition, the majority of work so far has focused on a small set of application domains and threat models.

  <p>
    This workshop will bring together experts from the computer security and machine learning communities in an attempt to highlight recent work that contribute to address these challenges. Our agenda will complement contributed papers with invited speakers. The latter will emphasize connections between ML security and other research areas such as accountability or formal verification, as well as stress social aspects of ML misuses. We hope this will help identify fundamental directions for future cross-community collaborations, thus charting a path towards secure and trustworthy ML.
  </p>

  <h2>Call For Papers</h2>
  <p>The workshop will include contributed papers. Based on the PC’s recommendation, each paper accepted to the workshop will be allocated either a contributed talk or spotlight presentation, in addition to a poster slot.</p>
  <p>A program committee, call for papers (CFP) and submission deadline will be available soon.</p>
